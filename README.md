# ðŸ§  Political Bias Detection in News Media using RAG

### ðŸ“˜ Summary
This project analyzes political bias in news coverage using a custom **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.  
It combines transformer-based summarization and semantic retrieval to interpret ideological framing across diverse media sources.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To develop a transparent AI system that can identify and explain left, right, and center political lean in online news articles â€”  
enhancing media literacy and accountability in automated text analysis.

### ðŸ§© Methodology
- Implemented **semantic chunking** and **FAISS-based dense retrieval** using Sentence Transformers  
- Used **BART transformer** for summarization and bias interpretation  
- Combined **classifier-based labeling** (left/right/center) to validate model outputs  
- Focused on **interpretability and transparency** within the NLP bias detection pipeline

### ðŸ§  Dataset
- Curated **1,000+ political articles** from six ideologically diverse sources  
- Topics include: *Climate Change*, *Immigration*, and *Israel-Palestine Conflict*  
- Data not shared publicly due to collection ethics and copyright considerations  

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Python Â· Hugging Face Transformers Â· FAISS Â· Sentence Transformers Â· BART Â· scikit-learn Â· Pandas Â· Matplotlib

### ðŸ“Š Key Outcomes
- Produced interpretable bias summaries linking retrieved evidence with generated text  
- Enhanced transparency and fairness in bias classification  
- Demonstrated RAGâ€™s potential for media bias research
